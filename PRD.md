# Product Requirements Document: CultureCrunch MVP

**Product Name:** CultureCrunch - AI-Powered Psychosocial Safety Platform  
**Document Owner:** Product Team  
**Last Updated:** October 19, 2025  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** In Development - Pilot Phase  
**Target Release:** Q1 2026 (12-Week Pilot Program)

---

## Executive Summary

**What:** CultureCrunch is a B2B SaaS platform that transforms workplace psychosocial compliance into actionable leadership insights using AI, specifically designed for Australian aged care providers.

**Why:** Aged care faces a critical workforce crisis: 30-50% annual turnover, escalating mental health claims (average cost $58,600 per claim), and new psychosocial safety regulations. Traditional engagement tools fail because they're too complex, create surveillance concerns, and don't address the operational reality of span-of-control challenges in aged care.

**Impact:** By converting psychosocial compliance requirements into a lightweight pulse-to-action system, CultureCrunch enables care managers to proactively address team wellbeing in 15 minutes per week, reducing turnover by 25%, mental health claims by 40%, and improving engagement by 30%.

**Business Model:** Founding partner program ($15,000/year) → Pilot validation → SaaS subscription at scale

## 1. Problem Statement

### Market Context

**Australian Aged Care Workforce Crisis (2025):**
- **Turnover Crisis:** 30-50% annual turnover rate (vs 15-20% general workforce)
- **Financial Impact:** Turnover costs 70% of salary per departure ($49,000 average)
- **Mental Health:** Mental health claims cost $58,600 per claim, increasing 15% YoY
- **Regulatory Pressure:** New psychosocial safety regulations require proactive hazard management
- **Staffing Shortage:** 110,000 workers needed by 2030 (Aged Care Workforce Census)

### Customer Pain Points

**For Care Managers & RNs:**
1. **Impossible Span of Control:** Managing 20-40+ staff across shifts with no time for proactive culture work
2. **Reactive Crisis Management:** Only addressing issues after resignations, complaints, or incidents
3. **Compliance Overwhelm:** Psychosocial safety requirements seen as "more paperwork" rather than useful tools
4. **Limited Leadership Time:** 60-80 hour weeks leave no capacity for meaningful team conversations

**For Frontline Staff:**
1. **Feeling Unheard:** High workload, emotional demands, and minimal leadership visibility
2. **Survey Fatigue:** Long, complex surveys that never lead to visible action
3. **Privacy Concerns:** Fear of surveillance, retaliation for honest feedback
4. **Disengagement:** Low trust in management to address psychosocial hazards

**For Executives:**
1. **High Turnover Costs:** $2-3M annual turnover costs for 150-200 staff facilities
2. **Compliance Risk:** Potential fines, litigation, reputational damage from psychosocial incidents
3. **Retention Crisis:** Unable to fill vacancies, quality of care declining
4. **ROI Uncertainty:** Unclear which culture interventions actually work

### Competitive Landscape Gaps

**Why Existing Solutions Fail:**
1. **Generic Engagement Platforms:** Not designed for aged care operational realities (shift work, high turnover, RN span-of-control)
2. **Survey Fatigue:** 20-50 question surveys quarterly → low completion, no action
3. **Surveillance Concerns:** Detailed individual tracking creates fear, not trust
4. **No Guidance:** Data dashboards without actionable leadership conversations
5. **Implementation Complexity:** Require dedicated HR/culture teams that aged care facilities don't have

   - Output: Headline + Summary + Conversation Prompt
3. Human review: Grant Dale approves/edits (pilot phase only)

| HR consultancies | Software + coaching hybrid, scalable beyond 1-on-1 consulting |

## 11. Risks & Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Low pulse completion rate (<70%) | Pilot failure, no valid data | Medium | SMS reminders, manager encouragement, simplify to 2 questions if needed |
| AI brief quality issues | Leader disengagement | Low | Human review (Grant Dale) for all briefs during pilot |
| Mobile compatibility issues | Frontline staff can't access | Low | Test on 15 devices pre-launch, progressive enhancement |
| Database performance (>500 users) | Slow dashboards | Low | Neon autoscaling, query optimization, caching layer |
| Magic link delivery failures | Survey not received | Medium | Dual delivery (SMS + email), fallback to manual send |

---

### Business Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Founding partners don't sign LOI | Pilot delayed | Medium | Expand outreach, soften commitment (non-binding), offer extended trial |
| ROI not validated in pilot | PMF failure | Medium | Conservative projections, focus on engagement first (leading indicator) |
| Competitor launches similar tool | Market share loss | Low | Speed to market (pilot by Dec 2025), Genos partnership exclusivity |
| Regulatory changes (psychosocial laws) | Compliance mismatch | Low | Monthly monitoring of Safe Work Australia updates, legal review Q2 2026 |
| Pricing too high for market | Low adoption post-pilot | Medium | Flexible pricing tiers, ROI calculator to justify cost, offer monthly vs annual |

---

### Adoption Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Frontline staff distrust (surveillance fears) | <50% completion rate | High | Clear privacy messaging, team-level only, no manager access to individual data |
| Leaders don't act on briefs | No outcome improvement | Medium | Coaching from Grant Dale, actionable conversation prompts, track action logging |
| Survey fatigue (weekly too frequent) | Declining completion over time | Medium | Alternate 3-question / 2-question weeks, seasonal breaks (Christmas) |
| Change resistance from staff | Low engagement | Medium | Manager champions explain "why", celebrate early wins, visible actions |

---

### Mitigation Summary

**Top 3 Critical Risks:**
1. **Low pulse completion (<70%)** → Weekly reminders, manager encouragement, A/B test survey length
2. **ROI not validated** → Conservative projections (20% improvement vs 30% claimed), focus on engagement as leading indicator
3. **Privacy distrust** → Transparent communication, never show individual data, third-party privacy audit

## 12. Open Questions & Decisions

| Question | Owner | Status | Decision / Next Steps |
|----------|-------|--------|----------------------|
| Should we offer quarterly pulse option (vs weekly)? | Campbell | Open | Pilot will test weekly; gather feedback Week 6 |
| Free tier for <50 staff facilities? | Ivan | Open | Discuss post-pilot based on CAC analysis |
| White-label option for aged care consultancies? | Campbell | Open | Defer to 2026 H2 after PMF validated |
| Multi-language support priority (Spanish, Mandarin)? | Ivan | Open | Pilot English only; assess demand in customer interviews |
| Self-serve signup vs sales-led only? | Campbell | **Resolved** | Pilot: sales-led; Post-pilot: self-serve for <150 staff |
| Custom survey questions (beyond 3)? | Grant | **Resolved** | Not in pilot; consider post-pilot if validated use cases emerge |
| API integration priority order? | Ivan | Open | Survey customers Month 3 post-pilot; likely HRIS first (deputy, Tanda) |

## 13. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

**Explicitly NOT Building (Pilot Phase):**
1. ❌ Native mobile apps (iOS/Android) → Web mobile-first sufficient
2. ❌ Performance management / appraisal tools → Stay focused on wellbeing, not performance review
3. ❌ Individual coaching / therapy referrals → Platform provides insights, not clinical interventions
4. ❌ Resident satisfaction surveys → Staff wellbeing only (aged care provider focus)
5. ❌ Payroll / rostering integrations → CSV workflow sufficient for pilot scale
6. ❌ Multi-tenant white-label → Single product brand for now
7. ❌ Gamification / rewards → Risk of trivializing psychosocial safety
8. ❌ Social features (chat, kudos) → Avoid feature bloat, focus on core value

**Rationale:** These features either add complexity without validating core value proposition, or address needs beyond MVP scope. Revisit post-PMF based on customer demand.
