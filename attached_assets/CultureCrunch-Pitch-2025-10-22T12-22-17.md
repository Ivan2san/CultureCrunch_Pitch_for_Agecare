## Vision

A world where every aged care leader can spot psychosocial risks early and turn them into the conversations, actions, and habits that build a high performance culture.

## Problem


### A Crisis at the Intersection of Compliance, Workforce, and Care

Aged care faces unprecedented regulatory pressure while managing a workforce crisis—with virtually no practical tools to address psychosocial safety.


#### The Crisis in Numbers


##### Human Cost

Experiencing burnout

quite often or very often

— Palliative Care Australia 2024

Annual turnover rate

industry consensus

— Aged Care Workforce Survey 2024


##### Financial Impact

Per staff replacement

Australian aged care sector

— Roche et al. 2015

Mental health claim

5x cost of physical injuries

— Safe Work Australia 2024


##### Compliance Pressure

Feel confident

meeting psychosocial requirements

— ACCPA State of Sector 2024

Expect greater strain

from new requirements

— ACCPA State of Sector 2024


##### Market Gap

Aged care-specific tools

for psychosocial safety

— CultureCrunch Market Scan 2025

Cite burnout

as #1 reason for leaving

— Aged Care Worker Survey 2024


##### Why Current Tools Fail

Comprehensive market scan found zero aged care-specific psychosocial safety platforms. Existing tools focus on clinical documentation, rostering, or generic workplace surveys—none address the sector's unique challenges: dementia care, emotional labor, resident aggression, and death exposure.

What's Missing:

- • Proactive culture monitoring
- • Early warning systems
- • Sector-specific hazard libraries
Result:

- • 69% say reform pace too fast
- • 74% need 6+ months to implement
- • Only 30% have financial resources

## Why Now


### WHY NOW: Three forces converge

Clear lanes show regulatory pressure, leaders under strain from external forces, and the leap in technology capability—meeting at a single decision point.


#### Aged Care Regulatory Tsunami

(2023–2025)

- Standards 7 & 2 effective Nov 1, 2025: 'satisfied and psychologically safe workplace' now mandatory
- 17 specific WHS psychosocial hazards to identify, assess, control—proactive risk management required
- Personal liability for directors/executives failing due diligence + penalties up to $1.5M per breach

#### Workforce Crisis & Burnout

(2023–2025)

- 43,000 vacancies now; 84,900 staff left in 12 months (27% turnover)
- Mental health claims: $58.6K median, 34 weeks off (4x other injuries)
- Only 49% of workers say workload is manageable

#### Technology Maturity for Aged Care

(2024–2025)

- Modern systems can now detect burnout patterns in real-time
- Privacy-preserving analysis suitable for aged care compliance
- Transforms reactive incident response into proactive risk management

##### The Convergence Point

Aged care compliance mandates × Workforce crisis × Data intelligence → the moment to transform psychosocial risk into retention.

## Accountable Conversations


### Accountable Conversations


##### Building Psych Safety Through Human Dialogue

While the Culture Crunch system installs weekly structure and insight, Accountable Conversations build the human capability beneath it. This high-EQ leadership model trains leaders to communicate with clarity, care, and courage - creating alignment without blame, and connection without avoidance. It’s a universal conversational practice that strengthens performance, trust, and psychological safety across every level of work. It’s the backbone of the Culture Crunch system.


###### The Mindset: Installing the Right Mindset for Accountable Conversations

Every accountable conversation begins with intention—not correction. Leaders pause to self-regulate, check their motives, and centre on values before they speak.


###### The Skillset: O.O.R.A. in Action

A simple, high-trust structure keeps conversations clean and accountable: Always ask yourself: "What's My Part In This", then "Is there an unmet need in the other I can acknowledge". Start the conversation here.


###### The Theory

Evidenced based emotionally intelligent leadership models driving Accountable Conversations which are grounded in:


###### In Practice

In aged care and other human-centred settings, Accountable Conversations protect dignity, restore trust, and keep people connected to purpose.
