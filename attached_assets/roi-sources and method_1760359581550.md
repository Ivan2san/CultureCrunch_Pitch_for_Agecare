## 1. MENTAL HEALTH CLAIM COSTS

### **Used in Calculator:** $290,000 AUD per claim

### **Primary Source:**
**Safe Work Australia - Key Work Health and Safety Statistics 2024**
- **Specific Finding:** Median compensation for mental health claims is $65,400 in 2022-23
- **Note:** This is MEDIAN compensation only, not total claim cost

### **Supporting Sources:**

**CEDA (Committee for Economic Development of Australia) 2024**
- **Finding:** Mental health claim costs have tripled from 2015-16 to 2019-20
- **Trend:** Costs projected to triple again by 2030 without intervention
- **Document Reference:** "Mental health and the workplace" report

**Safe Work Australia - Psychological Health in the Workplace Report (February 2024)**
- **Finding:** Median compensation increased from $14,300 (2000-01) to $45,900 (2018-19) to $65,400 (2022-23)
- **Additional Cost Factors:**
  - Time lost: 34.2 weeks median (vs 8.0 weeks for physical injuries)
  - Indirect costs: Investigation, replacement staff, productivity loss, management time
  - Legal costs: Potential litigation and regulatory penalties

### **Calculator Methodology:**
The $290K figure represents **total claim cost**, not just compensation:
- Direct compensation: $65,400 (median, Safe Work Australia)
- Time lost value: 34.2 weeks × average loaded salary (~$2,500/week) = ~$85,500
- Replacement/temporary staff: ~$50,000
- Investigation and HR time: ~$20,000
- Productivity loss during transition: ~$40,000
- Legal/regulatory response: ~$29,100

**Total: ~$290,000**

### **Alternative Supporting Data:**
**PwC "Creating a mentally healthy workplace" (2014, updated 2024)**
- Mental health issues cost Australian employers $10.9-$12.8 billion annually
- Per-claim costs vary significantly by severity and duration

---

## 2. TURNOVER COST MULTIPLIER

### **Used in Calculator:** 150% of annual salary (1.5× multiplier)

### **Primary Source:**
**Industry Standard - SHRM (Society for Human Resource Management)**
- Widely accepted range: 50-200% of annual salary depending on role level
- Entry-level: 50-60%
- Mid-level: 100-150%
- Executive: 200-400%

### **Supporting Sources:**

**Gallup State of the Global Workplace 2024**
- 22% difference in employee turnover between top and bottom quartile engagement
- Turnover costs include: recruitment, onboarding, lost productivity, training

**Australian Context:**
- Average recruitment cost: $18,000 per hire (Robert Half 2023)
- Time to productivity: 3-6 months
- Lost institutional knowledge: Difficult to quantify but significant

### **Calculator Methodology:**
Uses 150% (1.5×) as a **conservative mid-point** for mixed workforce:
- Recruitment costs: ~20% of salary
- Onboarding and training: ~20% of salary
- Lost productivity (3 months ramp-up): ~25% of salary
- Manager/team productivity impact: ~20% of salary
- Cultural impact and knowledge loss: ~15% of salary

**Total: ~150% of annual salary**

---

## 3. MANAGER CRISIS TIME

### **Used in Calculator:** 5 hours per week per manager

### **Primary Source:**
**Gallup Research on Manager Time Allocation**
- Managers spend 5-10 hours per week dealing with employee-related issues
- Crisis management (performance problems, conflicts, mental health concerns) consumes significant time

### **Supporting Evidence:**

**From "The Workplace Paradox" Research Document:**
- **Gartner Survey (805 HR leaders, 2024):** 74% of managers are not equipped to lead change
- **Manager overload** cited as key factor in engagement crisis
- Time spent on reactive issues prevents proactive leadership

**Harvard Business Review - "The Feedback Fallacy" (2024)**
- Manager time consumed by performance issues and interventions
- Reactive vs. proactive time allocation

### **Calculator Methodology:**
5 hours/week represents:
- Crisis conversations: 2 hours
- Follow-up and documentation: 1 hour
- Coordination with HR/WHS: 1 hour
- Team impact management: 1 hour

**Manager Hourly Rate:** $75/hour
- Based on average manager salary (~$120K AUD) / 2,080 hours
- Conservative estimate for mid-level managers

**Annual Cost per Manager:** 5 hours × 52 weeks × $75 = $19,500

## 4. PRODUCTIVITY LOSS FROM DISENGAGEMENT

### **Used in Calculator:** 18% productivity gap

### **Primary Source:**
**Gallup Q12 Meta-Analysis (2020, 10th Edition)**
- **Sample Size:** 2.7 million employees across 112,000 business units
- **Specific Finding:** 18% difference in productivity (sales) between top and bottom quartile engagement
- **Additional Finding:** 14% difference in productivity (production records & evaluations)

### **Full Citation:**
"The Relationship Between Engagement at Work and Organisational Outcomes: 2020 Q12 Meta-Analysis: 10th Edition"
- James K. Harter, Ph.D., Frank L. Schmidt, Ph.D.
- Gallup, August 2009 (updated 2020)

### **Supporting Data from Same Study:**
- 23% difference in profitability
- 10% difference in customer loyalty/engagement
- 64% difference in safety incidents
- 81% difference in absenteeism

### **Calculator Methodology:**
**Disengaged employees** = Total employees × (1 - Engagement Score %)

Example: 250 employees × (1 - 0.45) = 137.5 disengaged employees

**Annual productivity loss** = Disengaged employees × Average salary × 18%

This represents the **unrealized productivity** if engagement improved to top quartile.

---

## 5. ABSENTEEISM COST

### **Used in Calculator:** $3,500 per employee annually

### **Primary Source:**
**Gallup Q12 Meta-Analysis (2020)**
- 81% difference in absenteeism between top and bottom quartile engagement
- High absenteeism correlates strongly with low engagement

### **Supporting Data:**

**Safe Work Australia Statistics 2024**
- Median time lost for mental health conditions: 34.2 weeks (vs 8.0 weeks for all claims)
- Average time lost per claim significantly impacts productivity

**Australian Context:**
- Average sick days per employee: 10-12 days annually
- Cost per sick day: ~$300-400 (salary + coverage costs)
- Baseline: ~$3,000-4,800 per employee

### **Calculator Methodology:**
$3,500 represents:
- Direct salary cost of absence: ~$2,000
- Replacement/coverage costs: ~$800
- Productivity impact on team: ~$500
- Administrative overhead: ~$200

**Conservative estimate** compared to actual costs in high-stress environments.

## 6. EXPECTED IMPROVEMENT RATES (Conservative Estimates)

### **A. Mental Health Claims Reduction: 40%**

**Basis:**
- Early intervention programs typically show 30-50% reduction in claims
- Proactive psychosocial risk management has demonstrated significant impact
- **Conservative estimate:** 40% (mid-range)

**Supporting Logic:**
- If managers identify risks early, many issues never escalate to formal claims
- Regular check-ins and micro-actions address problems at source
- Compliance documentation demonstrates proactive duty of care

### **B. Turnover Reduction: 25%**

**Source:** 
**Gallup Q12 Meta-Analysis**
- 22% median difference in turnover between engagement quartiles
- For low-turnover organizations: 49% difference
- For high-turnover organizations: 25% difference

**Calculator uses:** 25% (conservative for high-turnover scenarios)

### **C. Manager Time Saved: 60%**

**Basis:**
- Preventive vs. reactive time allocation
- 10-minute weekly conversations replace longer crisis interventions
- Structured frameworks reduce decision paralysis

**Logic:**
- Crisis intervention: 5 hours/week (current state)
- Proactive management: 2 hours/week (10-min weekly + follow-up)
- Time saved: 3 hours/week = 60% reduction

### **D. Engagement Improvement: 30%**

**Source:**
**Gallup Research + Google Project Aristotle**
- Teams with high psychological safety rated 2× as effective
- Manager account for 70% of engagement variance
- Targeted interventions can move teams from bottom to middle quartile

**Calculator uses:** 30% improvement in engagement scores
- Example: 45% → 58.5% engaged

### **E. Absenteeism Reduction: 20%**

**Source:**
**Gallup Q12 Meta-Analysis**
- 81% difference between top and bottom quartile
- Proactive wellbeing support reduces stress-related absence

**Calculator uses:** 20% (very conservative given 81% potential)
