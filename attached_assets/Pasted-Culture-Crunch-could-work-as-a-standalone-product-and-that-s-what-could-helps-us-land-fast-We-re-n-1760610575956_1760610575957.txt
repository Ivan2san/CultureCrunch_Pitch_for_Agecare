Culture Crunch could work as a standalone product, and that’s what could helps us land fast. We’re not trying to replace HR, scheduling or payroll. We sit alongside those systems to solve one focused job: psychosocial compliance and team wellbeing.

Why standalone works

Self-contained compliance/wellbeing system, not a systems replacement.

Clear scope: capture weekly signals, turn them into actionable briefs, track follow-through.

Low lift for the provider, high speed for us.

Standalone workflow

Initial setup (Admin/Manager)

Create org (e.g., “Sunnyview Aged Care”).

Create teams (e.g., “Registered Nurses – Ward A”, “Personal Carers – Ward B”).

Add staff by CSV or manual entry: name, email, role, team.

Weekly pulse (Staff)

Friday 3 pm: magic-link emails go out.

One-click login, 3 questions, 2 minutes.

Stored anonymously; results only shown when k≥3 respondents.

AI briefs (Automated)

Monday 6 am: aggregate last week’s pulse; privacy guardrails on.

Generate manager-specific briefs with micro-actions.

Deliver via email.

Manager action (During the week)

Manager opens dashboard via magic link.

Reviews trends, chooses actions, logs completion.

Weekly loop repeats.

What this avoids

No IT approvals: no APIs, no system access, minimal security process.

No data migration: start clean; no legacy imports.

No SSO complexity: magic links work immediately.

No vendor-lock fears: we don’t “open up” their core systems.

Fast pilots: start with one team, prove value, then scale.

The value proposition (how we’d phrase it)

“Send us your staff email list. We’ll handle the rest. Every Monday your managers receive AI-powered team insights. No IT work required.”

Why this lands in aged care:

Many facilities run outdated or brittle IT that’s slow to integrate.

Compliance is easier to approve if data stays contained and anonymous.

Pilots in weeks, not months, so momentum isn’t lost.

Optional integration later (after proof)

Identity: SSO/SAML with their existing identity provider.

HR sync: auto-update staff and roles from their HR system.

Rostering: map teams automatically from schedules.

Analytics: export to their BI tools for executive roll-ups.

Bottom line: standalone is our go-to-market strength. We sell to care managers, deliver value in weeks, and only then have the “integration” conversation for expansion.
