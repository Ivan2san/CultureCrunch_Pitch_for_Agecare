Solution

What it is
A lightweight weekly system that helps aged-care leaders run safer, steadier teams by focusing on one meaningful shift per week. Each Monday, leaders receive a plain-English AI Brief, run a 20-minute OORA conversation, choose one micro-action, and watch evidence build through the week.
